# pintos

Pintos is an university project in my second year at Imperial College London for the Operating Systems module. 
Developed in C by a team of four students on top of the initial framework of the Pintos OS.

Key features implemented by us:
  - Non-busy sleeping threads
  - Priority scheduling (for threads) using semaphores, locks etc.
  - User programs with access to files and systemcalls
  - Virtual memory
